# AI Video Generation

---

## Overview
This project proposes a **multi-AI pipeline** for generating animated videos and movies efficiently. Instead of one large AI doing everything badly, the system splits responsibilities across specialized AI modules that work together.

The goal:
- Faster video generation
- Strong visual consistency
- Easy corrections and iteration
- Affordable tools for small creators

## The Core Problem
Current AI video generation has major limitations:

- Video generation is slow and expensive
- Results are inconsistent across frames
- Small creators cannot afford studios or render farms
- Making corrections means regenerating everything
- AI struggles to keep characters and scenes consistent

## The Proposed Solution: AI Pipeline

Instead of one AI doing everything, we use **multiple focused AI modules**:

### 1. Character & Scene Creator AI
- Generates characters, environments, and props
- Maintains design consistency
- Outputs layered assets ready for animation

### 2. Animator AI
- Animates characters using generated assets
- Handles motion, expressions, and camera movement
- Works in 2D or simplified 3D for speed

### 3. Grader / Critic AI
- Evaluates animation quality
- Checks consistency, errors, and realism
- Sends feedback back for regeneration if needed

### 4. Human Review (Optional)
- Final output is reviewed by humans
- Only high-quality results reach this stage

**Pipeline Flow:**
Creator → Animator → Grader → (Fix or Approve) → Human

## Why This Works Better
- Parallel AI specialization
- Faster iteration loops
- No full re-renders for small changes
- Scales from short clips to full movies
- Ideal for 2D animation where rendering is minimal
